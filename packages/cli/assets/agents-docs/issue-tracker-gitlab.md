# Issue tracker: GitLab

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitLab issues. Use the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `glab issue create --title "..." --description "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line descriptions. Pass `--description -` to open an editor.
- **Read an issue**: `glab issue view <number> --comments`. Use `-F json` for machine-readable output.
- **List issues**: `glab issue list -F json` with appropriate `--label` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `glab issue note <number> --message "..."`. GitLab calls comments "notes".
- **Apply / remove labels**: `glab issue update <number> --label "..."` / `--unlabel "..."`. Multiple labels can be comma-separated or by repeating the flag.
- **Close**: `glab issue close <number>`. `glab issue close` does not accept a closing comment, so post the explanation first with `glab issue note <number> --message "..."`, then close.
- **Merge requests**: GitLab calls PRs "merge requests". Use `glab mr create`, `glab mr view`, `glab mr note`, etc. — the same shape as `gh pr ...` with `mr` in place of `pr` and `note`/`--message` in place of `comment`/`--body`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `glab` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

Unlike GitHub, GitLab numbers issues and MRs separately, so `#42` is unambiguous once you know which surface is meant.

## Labels

The Launchrail workflow's label vocabulary — the skills quote these exact strings:

- **`ready-for-agent`** — an implementable ticket the implementation loop may pick up. Only tickets wear it; the loop's frontier is computed from this label alone and cannot tell prose from work.
- **`needs-info`** — a parked ticket, carrying its failure history; a human unblocks it.
- **`spec`** — a spec or research note published to the tracker. Never `ready-for-agent`.
- **`ralph:building`** — claimed by an implementer; removed when its MR merges.
- **`wayfinder:map`** / **`wayfinder:<type>`** — a wayfinder map and its decision tickets (see below).

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitLab issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `glab issue view <number> --comments`.

## Specs and their tickets

The stage-7 spec ([ADR-0025](https://github.com/wemuda/launchrail/blob/master/docs/adr/0025-spec-home-follows-tracker.md)) is itself an issue here — created by `launch-spec`, labelled **`spec`**, never `ready-for-agent`. There is no `docs/specs/` file; the issue is the canonical spec. When `launch-tickets` breaks it down, each ticket carries `Part of #<spec>` at the top of its description (on tiers with native epics, the spec may be an epic holding the tickets instead). Design validation revises the spec issue in place (its `## Design validation` section lives in the issue description).

## The spec's milestone (rollup view)

The spec issue and its tickets are also bundled under a **GitLab milestone** named for the feature, so the tracker shows one progress rollup as tickets close. The milestone is a **rollup, not the spec's home**: the `spec`-labelled issue stays canonical ([ADR-0025](https://github.com/wemuda/launchrail/blob/master/docs/adr/0025-spec-home-follows-tracker.md)), and the milestone description holds only a one-line goal and a link back to that issue.

- **Create it** (`launch-spec`, once per spec): a project milestone — `glab api --method POST "projects/:id/milestones" -f title='<feature>' -f description='<one-line goal> — spec: <spec-issue-url>'` (or make it in the GitLab UI). A group-level milestone works too where the feature spans projects.
- **Put an issue in it**: pass `--milestone '<feature>'` to `glab issue create`, or `glab issue update <n> --milestone '<feature>'` after the fact. `launch-spec` adds the spec issue; `launch-tickets` adds every ticket to the same milestone.
- **Find the milestone a spec already carries** (`launch-tickets`): `glab issue view <spec> -F json` and read its `milestone`.
- **Progress** is computed by GitLab from closed-vs-open issues — no upkeep.

An issue belongs to at most one milestone, so each ticket rolls up to exactly one spec. Milestones carry no labels and take no part in the implementation loop's frontier — they are purely the human-facing rollup, never a substitute for the `spec` issue.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `launch-wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `glab issue create --label wayfinder:map`. (On GitLab tiers with native epics, an epic may hold the map instead; a labelled issue works everywhere.)
- **Child ticket**: an issue carrying `Part of #<map>` at the top of its description and labels `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitLab's **native blocking link** — the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add it with the `/blocked_by #<n>` quick action, posted as a note (`glab issue note <child> --message "/blocked_by #<blocker>"`). Native blocking links are a Premium/Ultimate feature; on the free tier (or where unavailable) fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the description. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: `glab issue list -F json` scoped to the map's children, drop any with an open blocker — a native `blocked_by` link to an open issue (`glab api projects/:id/issues/:iid/links`), or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line — or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `glab issue update <n> --assignee @me` — the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `glab issue note <n> --message "<answer>"`, then `glab issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
